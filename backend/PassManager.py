#Fernet: https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/encrypt-decrypt-files-symmetric-python

#In short: 
#a) Fernet generates a key, that key can be used to encrypt and decrypt data. It may look like this
#   "9AFosuDE9Ytk4dPXUDhyPdMhus0_d5knBp585mLlGs4=""
#b) Next, a blank dictionary should be made and saved to a file called "Vault.txt". Here is where passwords will be stored. in a format like 
#	{"Netflix":"P@55w0rd!", "Amazon":"Password123!"}
#c) The key will be used to encrypt and decrypt the data in Vault.
#d) When not in use, the key should be zipped with a password (the master password). This will only be unzipped to decrypt or encrypt "Vault.txt"

#TODO: 
"""
1) UI 
2) check to make sure passwords generated are unique within the Vault
3) something to prevent brute forcing passwords
4) a fix for getFernetKey so that when a password error is thrown it does not brake the vault when it is encrypted
5) making sure the master password contains at least 8 characters, has upper and lowercase, a number, and a special character
6) Autolock in case of error
7) Delete a password
8) Make sure names for passwords are unique within the vault
